        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I made a conscious decision to be a coder because I subscribe to the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai"> ikigai’</a> philosophy and coding is the intersection of all 4 requirements, passion, vocation, profession and mission for me.</p>
        <p>I played a lot of strategy and puzzle games and my choice of games and approach to games is the same reason I choose to go into science out of high school, because I like problem solving, analytical thinking and the scientific method.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I was not good enough to be paid to play games  and does the world really need more people to play games?</p>
        <p>In order to find what I actually enjoyed I started to try and do more things. As I was working for Northern Meat and Poultry Supplies I realised I had interest in artificial intelligence  by my habits on youtube. This was reinforced by me remembering when as a student harboured ambitions of creating AIs for games but that didn’t happen because I had little interest in computers.</p>
        <p>Now I understand how shallow my view on technology was and how important it is for the future. In particular the artificial intelligence has had some boons, for example Deepmind's AlphaGo and AlphaStar have had success which AI research thought wouldn’t be solved for 100 years.</p>

        <p>After trying to teach myself a bit of python utilising online resources, I wanted to accelerate my learning and decisively signed up for the software developer immersive at General Assembly. </p>
        <p>I found that coding is the place where my incisiveness can shine, the world is in desperate need of good, are willing to pay and after my course at General Assembly I can genuinely say that I loved it. </p>
        <p>The TL;DR to take away from this is: Coding is a mixture of what I’m good at, what I love, what the world needs and what I can be paid by doing.</p>
        <p>Right now I am trying to wrap my head around Amazon Web Services and CI/CD practices and will hopefully add another project using them.</p>
